# Cliqz for iOS

## Localization
Localization works as described in the [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/LocalizingYourApp/LocalizingYourApp.html) or [this helpful tutorial](https://medium.com/swift-india/localize-your-apps-to-support-multiple-languages-ios-localization-ac7b612dbc58). Strings files are included in the project and can be exported to and imported from Xliff files if necessary for translation by external translation agencies.

Strings files live in the `Translations` directory,

To test localization, you can edit your currently active scheme, and in "Options", set the "Application Language". Don't commit this change please.

Building the code
-----------------

1. Install the latest [Xcode developer tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple.
1. Install Carthage
    ```shell
    brew update
    brew install carthage
    ```
1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios
    ```
1. Pull in the project dependencies:
    ```shell
    cd firefox-ios
    sh ./bootstrap.sh
    ```
1. Open `Client.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
1. Build the `Fennec` scheme in Xcode.

## Building User Scripts

User Scripts (JavaScript injected into the `WKWebView`) are compiled, concatenated and minified using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). User Scripts to be aggregated are placed in the following directories:

```
/Client
|-- /Frontend
    |-- /UserContent
        |-- /UserScripts
            |-- /AllFrames
            |   |-- /AtDocumentEnd
            |   |-- /AtDocumentStart
            |-- /MainFrame
                |-- /AtDocumentEnd
                |-- /AtDocumentStart
```

This reduces the total possible number of User Scripts down to four. The compiled output from concatenating and minifying the User Scripts placed in these folders resides in `/Client/Assets` and are named accordingly:

* `AllFramesAtDocumentEnd.js`
* `AllFramesAtDocumentStart.js`
* `MainFrameAtDocumentEnd.js`
* `MainFrameAtDocumentStart.js`

To simplify the build process, these compiled files are checked-in to this repository. When adding or editing User Scripts, these files can be re-compiled with `webpack` manually. This requires Node.js to be installed and all required `npm` packages can be installed by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project. User Scripts can be compiled by running the following `npm` command in the root directory of the project:

```
npm run build
```

## Contributor guidelines

### Creating a pull request
* All pull requests must be associated with a specific Issue. If an issue doesn't exist please first create it.

### Swift style
* Swift code should generally follow the conventions listed at https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide.
  * Exception: we use 4-space indentation instead of 2.
  * This is a loose standard. We do our best to follow this style

### Whitespace
* New code should not contain any trailing whitespace.
* We recommend enabling both the "Automatically trim trailing whitespace" and "Including whitespace-only lines" preferences in Xcode (under Text Editing).
* <code>git rebase --whitespace=fix</code> can also be used to remove whitespace from your commits before issuing a pull request.

### Commits
* Each commit should have a single clear purpose. If a commit contains multiple unrelated changes, those changes should be split into separate commits.
* If a commit requires another commit to build properly, those commits should be squashed.
* Follow-up commits for any review comments should be squashed. Do not include "Fixed PR comments", merge commits, or other "temporary" commits in pull requests.
